## The Organisation
In the folders A1, A2, B1, and B2, you will find both Jupyter Notebooks and Python files for each attempted model at the task as well as additional files that may be needed to run the code such as 
```bash
shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat
```
The Datasets should be pasted into the folder labelled datasets in the following format.

Inside the sub folders for celeba and cartoon_set, there must be a folder labelled "img" and a csv file labelled "labels"
This also applies to the celeba_test and cartoon_set_test
